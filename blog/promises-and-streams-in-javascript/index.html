        <p>Let&#39;s explore this topic in a practical way! I want a function that <strong>reads a file</strong> and another that <strong>writes a file</strong>. But files can be small or big, text or binary, so we want to allow them to read the whole file at once with a promise, or pipe it to another file in chunks. The API should look like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// demo.js
import { read, write } from &quot;./simplefs.js&quot;;

// Works with Promises
const data = await read(&quot;./readme.md&quot;);
await write(&quot;./readme2.md&quot;, data);

// Works with traditional Node.js Streams
read(&quot;./readme.md&quot;).pipe(write(&quot;./readme3.md&quot;));

// Works with the new Web Streams
read(&quot;./readme.md&quot;).pipeTo(write(&quot;./readme4.md&quot;));
</code></pre>
<p>I am also not sure what to expect here, while I&#39;m very familiar with the inner workings of Promises, I&#39;m only at the user-level familiar with <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html">Node.js Streams</a>, and totally unfamiliar with <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/webstreams.html">WebStreams</a>, the new Node.js abstraction. But let&#39;s try to make that work anyway!</p>

    <h2 id="it-all-starts-with-a-promise">
      It all starts with a Promise
    </h2>
  <p>Let&#39;s start first with Promises, we want to make an API that allows us to simply do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// demo.js
import { read, write } from &quot;./simplefs.js&quot;;

// Works with Promises
const data = await read(&quot;./readme.md&quot;);
await write(&quot;./readme2.md&quot;, data);
</code></pre>
<p>Promises is the one I&#39;m most familiar with and the default one for small files. This should look like a thin wrapper since we have a very similar API in <code>fs/promises</code> already:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import { readFile, writeFile } from &quot;node:fs/promises&quot;;

// simplefs.js
export const read = (path) =&gt; {
  return readFile(path, &quot;utf-8&quot;);
};

export const write = (path, data) =&gt; {
  // Returning a promise is the same as making the whole file async
  return writeFile(path, data);
};
</code></pre>
<p>üöÇ Let&#39;s test it! We write a minimal <code>package.json</code> and run <code>node demo.js</code>, and we see that our demo.js correctly writes the file <code>readme2.md</code> with the same content as this file!</p>
<p>But we only want the <code>read()</code> to use promises when calling it with <code>await</code> or <code>.then()</code>, and the <code>write()</code> when it receives some data, so let&#39;s modify our functions to reflect that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: calling <code>await fn()</code> is practically the same as calling <code>fn().then()</code>, with some minor differences that are not relevant for this article.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-js">export const read = (path) =&gt; {
  return {
    // A promise is abstracted just like this! It&#39;s just a function that
    // receives a CB and passing the resolution value into it
    then: async (cb) =&gt; cb(await readFile(path, &quot;utf-8&quot;)),
  };
};

export const write = (path, data) =&gt; {
  // Returning a promise is the same as making the whole file async
  if (typeof data !== &#39;undefined&#39;) {
    return writeFile(path, data);
  }
};
</code></pre>
<p>Now we have the promise behaviour occurring <em>only</em> when we are using promises. An empty file will return <code>&quot;&quot;</code>, and so the file is created even with empty files. So promises to promises condition is fulfilled! üéâ</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: we are simplifying and this is not Promise-compliant, or &quot;<a href="https://promisesaplus.com/">Promises A+</a>&quot; as it&#39;s called.</p>
</blockquote>

    <h2 id="node-js-streams">
      Node.js streams
    </h2>
  <p>Now let&#39;s try to work with the streams, starting with the traditional Node.js pipes. We want to achieve the ability of doing this, without hampering the previous promises workflow:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// demo.js
import { read, write } from &quot;./simplefs.js&quot;;

// Works with traditional pipes
read(&quot;./readme.md&quot;).pipe(write(&quot;./readme3.md&quot;));
</code></pre>
<p>For that, we&#39;ll import and use it only when &quot;.pipe()&quot; is called:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// simplefs.js
import { readFile, writeFile } from &quot;node:fs/promises&quot;;
import { createReadStream, createWriteStream } from &quot;node:fs&quot;;

export const read = (path) =&gt; ({
  then: async (cb) =&gt; cb(await readFile(path, &quot;utf-8&quot;)),

  // Our .pipe(writable) receives the writable stream, so create and pipe it
  pipe: (writable) =&gt; createReadStream(path).pipe(writable),
});

export const write = (path, data) =&gt; {
  if (typeof data !== &quot;undefined&quot;) {
    return writeFile(path, data);
  }
  // Create the writable stream if there&#39;s no data, assuming it&#39;s going to
  // receive a pipe
  return createWriteStream(path);
};
</code></pre>
<p>üöÇ Let&#39;s test it again with <code>node demo.js</code> and we see that once more, <code>readme3.md</code> is created with the correct data! Node.js streams seem to work properly üéâ</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: we are also simplifying A LOT here and this is not fully Node Stream-compliant.</p>
</blockquote>

    <h2 id="web-streams">
      Web Streams
    </h2>
  <p>Finally we want the ability of doing the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// demo.js
import { read, write } from &quot;./simplefs.js&quot;;

// Works with the new Web Streams
read(&quot;./readme.md&quot;).pipeTo(write(&quot;./readme4.md&quot;));
</code></pre>
<p>This is probably going to be the tricky one, specially in the <code>write()</code> since we don&#39;t have much room there for mistakes, but let&#39;s try anyway! First thing is to modify <code>read()</code> to add the <code>pipeTo()</code> characteristic of Web Streams. We&#39;re going to transform the Node.js stream to Web stream:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import { Readable, Writable } from &quot;node:stream&quot;;

export const read = (path) =&gt; ({
  // A promise is abstracted just like this! It&#39;s just a function that
  // receives a CB and passing the resolution value into it
  then: async (cb) =&gt; cb(await readFile(path, &quot;utf-8&quot;)),

  // Our .pipe(writable) receives the writable stream, so create and pipe it
  pipe: (writable) =&gt; createReadStream(path).pipe(writable),

  // When pipeTo, it&#39;s a webstream so convert it from Node to Web:
  pipeTo: (writable) =&gt; {
    return Readable.toWeb(createReadStream(path)).pipeTo(writable);
  }
});
</code></pre>
<p>However if we try to run this, it won&#39;t work since that <code>writable</code> is still a Node.js Stream and <code>pipeTo()</code> expects a Writable WebStream.</p>
<p>Since we have control over both <code>read()</code> and <code>write()</code>, let&#39;s do a couple of modifications to pick only the right write type depending on the piping method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">export const write = (path, data) =&gt; {
  ...

  // Depending on whether we are pipe()-ing or pipeTo()-ing, we&#39;ll call one
  // method or the other. This is not ideal since it doesn&#39;t interact properly
  // with native streams, but it&#39;s better than nothing
  return {
    node: () =&gt; createWriteStream(path),
    web: () =&gt; Writable.toWeb(createWriteStream(path)),
  };
};
</code></pre>
<p>While we could do that and then on write differentiate with <code>writeable.node()</code>, then we have a big problem: this is not a write stream anymore, it&#39;s a custom API that just happens to have the same name AND uses pipes deep down. You cannot work with the <code>write()</code> as you would normally work with a pipe in other cases. That&#39;s pretty bad, we want pipes to just be pipes, so let&#39;s try a different way:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">export const write = (path, data) =&gt; {
  // Returning a promise is the same as making the whole file async
  if (typeof data !== &quot;undefined&quot;) {
    return writeFile(path, data);
  }

  // Create the Node.js stream and overload it with the methods of WebStreams
  const stream = createWriteStream(path);
  const webStream = Writable.toWeb(createWriteStream(path));
  return Object.assign(stream, webStream);
};
</code></pre>
<p>What we are doing here is similar to how we fake the promise, but better. We are defining the output as a Node.js stream, and then overloading all of the methods of WebStream. We are not sure whether this will work or not, so let&#39;s try.</p>
<p>üöÇ Let&#39;s remove the duplicate files and run <code>node demo.js</code> and we can see that the files <code>readme2.md</code>, <code>readme3.md</code> and <code>readme4.md</code> are created successfully. This is... surprising, and I&#39;m not sure how I feel about doing it this way since there&#39;s a chance of method collision, but it seems to work so far so kudos! üéâ</p>

    <h2 id="putting-it-all-together">
      Putting it all together
    </h2>
  <p>This is our final file üéâ:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// simplefs.js
import { readFile, writeFile } from &quot;node:fs/promises&quot;;
import { createReadStream, createWriteStream } from &quot;node:fs&quot;;
import { Readable, Writable } from &quot;node:stream&quot;;

export const read = (path) =&gt; ({
  // A promise is abstracted just like this! It&#39;s just a function that
  // receives a CB and passing the resolution value into it
  then: async (cb) =&gt; cb(await readFile(path, &quot;utf-8&quot;)),

  // Our .pipe(writable) receives the writable stream, so create and pipe it
  pipe: (writable) =&gt; createReadStream(path).pipe(writable),

  // When pipeTo, it&#39;s a webstream so convert it from Node to Web:
  pipeTo: (writable) =&gt; {
    return Readable.toWeb(createReadStream(path)).pipeTo(writable);
  },
});

export const write = (path, data) =&gt; {
  // Returning a promise is the same as making the whole file async
  if (typeof data !== &quot;undefined&quot;) {
    return writeFile(path, data);
  }

  // Create the Node.js stream and overload it with the methods of WebStreams
  const stream = createWriteStream(path);
  const webStream = Writable.toWeb(stream);
  return Object.assign(stream, webStream);
};
</code></pre>
<p>We purposefully only followed the happy simplified path here. However, there&#39;s a lot of details that we skipped, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Promises also have <code>.catch()</code> and <code>.finally()</code>.</li>
<li>Node.js Streams have A LOT of other methods, like<code>.close()</code>, <code>.push()</code>, <code>.read()</code>, etc.</li>
<li>Web Streams ALSO have other methods.</li>
<li>We are ignoring <em>all</em> of the options that both the promises and streams can accept.</li>
</ul>
<p>We would need to make all of those to work properly if we want to call this a Promise or a Node/Web Stream properly. One possible hack/fix, at least on the <code>read()</code> side, is to make it all a ReadableStream that has the promise methods attached, like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">export const read = (path) =&gt; {
  const stream = createReadStream(path);
  stream.then = async cb =&gt; cb(await readFile(path, &quot;utf-8&quot;));
  stream.catch = // ...
  stream.finally = // ...
  const webStream = // ...
  return Object.assign(stream, webStream);
};
</code></pre>
<p>This allows us to make it be a stream by default and not need to worry about those methods and details, and only add the promise interface on top of it. However, I don&#39;t know enough of the internals of createReadStream to know if this would result in a double read, or even in potentially a memory leak, so I won&#39;t set that as &quot;the solution&quot;.</p>
<p>Maybe a better solution is not to try to overload a single method, but instead to keep it into separated helpers like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// demo.js
import { read, write } from &quot;./simplefs.js&quot;;

const data = await read(&quot;./readme.md&quot;);
await write(&quot;./readme2.md&quot;, data);

read.nodeStream(&quot;./readme.md&quot;).pipe(write.nodeStream(&quot;./readme3.md&quot;));

read.stream(&quot;./readme.md&quot;).pipeTo(write.stream(&quot;./readme4.md&quot;));
</code></pre>
<p>I&#39;m the author of the library <code>files</code> and I&#39;ll continue exploring this topic and adding this functionality to the library itself when I&#39;m confident enough! So make sure to star and watch the library:</p>
